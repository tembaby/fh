  Fetching non-existent document from a server will fail with 404 code and 
  revert back to try HTTP/1.0 which will show errornous status code (0)

  Never try fetching again on 404/403/40? (will have to save status code
  somewhere.

  Tested on localhost, while PPP link was up, and the download was
  serialized one after another!  Closed PPP link and tested again
  then it was working good as expected (OpenBSD 3.0).

- DOWNLOAD_RATE is not very accurate, sometimes it jumps to very
  high rates and then back to normal (FIXED).
